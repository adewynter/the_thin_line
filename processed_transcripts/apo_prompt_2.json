Because the government declares it so.\n   P2: Taxation is legal because it is established and regulated by the government through legislative processes and is upheld by the legal system.\n   P1: There is no inherent legitimacy in either of those though. Just they happen to have enough power to enforce and \"legitimise\" their theft\n   P2: The legitimacy of taxation stems from the authority granted to the government by the constitution or other governing documents, as well as from the consent of the governed, which is often expressed through democratic processes such as elections and representation.\n   P1: But some governments are undemocratic\n\n   CURRENT: Yes, that's correct.
